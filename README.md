# fdf - @42Born2Code

## What's the goal of fdf?

To create a 3D wireframe viewer that is capable of showing heightmaps from the .fdf file format.

## Why would you do this?

To learn how to use a given gui library (Minilibx in this case) and to create a graphical 3D wireframe view from scratch.

### What did i learn from it?

- How does a monitor/computer draw lines and what is necessary for it to look good.
- Bresenham algorithm (line drawing)
- Calculate the points in 3D space to get a 3D view of the map.
- How to efficently store the map data for later manipulating like: Transformation, rotation, Zoom, Altitude changes.
- Improve the rendering to be faster (Draw only what's visible)
